HighlightSearchWikipedia
========================

To use this script, you must have something like [GreaseMonkey]() or [TamperMonkey]() installed. Then, you can copy and paste my code into a new script. After you install it, simply highlight any text on a webpage you are hanging ten on, and when you right click with the mouse, an option will be there to search Wikipedia for that term. **BING, BADDA, BISH!!** Done.
